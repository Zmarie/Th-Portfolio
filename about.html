        <h2>Hi, There!</h2>
        <p>Ever since a very early age I have always been into the arts. I started graphic &amp; web
          designing at the age of 14 and fell in love. I knew then that's what I wanted to do. At the age
          of 19 I (<i>luckily</i>) began interning at a latin record label for a group I had designed a fan site for.
          I love to learn and expand my knowledge as much as possible! In this field, it's crucial one stays
          up-to-date with what's going on in this fast growing industry. I currently "keep updated"
          with the ever-changing web development world by studying at <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com" alt="Team Treehouse">Treehouse</a>.
          Yeah, it's awesome!</p>
          <p>I love coding the web, its challenging and quite exciting! When I'm not learning
            or studying, working on side projects, I love to sketch, read a good book (with my lovely
            cousin "Sad Eyes"), go out with friends, blog of my latest beauty obsessions, and do some
            good writing.</p>

          <p>You can find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/browneyedvegan">Twitter</a> and
            <a href="http://instagram.com/vixen2303">Instagram</a>. Stop by and say hi!</p>
