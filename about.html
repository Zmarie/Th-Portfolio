        <h2>Hi, There!</h2>
        <p>Ever since a very early age I have always been into the creative arts. I started graphic &amp; web
          designing at the age of 14 and fell in love. I've studied many things (Medical Assisting, 
          Music Engineering, Web and Media, even Acting - which is an amazing story on its own!) and it's
          all been great. I love to study and love to learn (can you tell?)! I currently "keep updated"
          with the ever-changing web development world by studying at Treehouse. Yeah, it's awesome.
          I love to draw but I'm nowhere as amazing as my dear cousin. I love coding the web, its
          challenging and quite exciting! When I'm not learning or studying, working on side projects,
          I love to sketch, read a good book (with my lovely cousin "Sad Eyes"), go out with friends,
          blog of my latest beauty obsessions, and do some good writing.

You can find me on Twitter, Instagram, and Code Pen. Stop by and say hi!</p>
        <p>I’m a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
